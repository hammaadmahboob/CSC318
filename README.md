# CSC318 High Fidelity Prototype


### If you download the beta of Framer X

You can simply open the `Project.framerx` file 

### To simply edit code

Go to Project Files/Container/Code

### To add a new module to the prototype

Go to .../Container/Build and add it to the correct Frame and Page. Note I forgot to name some of the navbars anything special but theres no more coding needed there so it's all good. 

The Iphone X window has three frames The scrolling content set to the Home Feed as the base frame. With the Community framer above that and the top nav bar (search + groups) above that. Interactions are occuring in the HomeFeed and will push to a new page/frame.. 

If you're confused just push your updated code and then I can add it.

Framer X component with two dropdown menus, where the selected option from the first dropdown filters the options from the second dropdown.

Based on component found here: https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-mvqwr7 by Jose Marmolejos.

Rewritten to a usable Framer X component by Emilie Ã˜rtoft.	
Any feedback/comments are welcome.


To add a 3rd dropdown menu just add the comments found throughout this code.
To add more, just copy the 3rd options from the comments and change everything accordingly.


Enjoy!
